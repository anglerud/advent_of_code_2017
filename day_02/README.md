# Problem

[Second day](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/2) of the Advent of Code.


## First problem:

> calculate the spreadsheet's checksum. For each row, determine the difference
> between the largest value and the smallest value; the checksum is the sum of
> all of these differences.


## Second problem:

> find the only two numbers in each row where one evenly divides the other -
> that is, where the result of the division operation is a whole number. They
> would like you to find those numbers on each line, divide them, and add up
> each line's result.
