# Problem setup:

Quoted from [Day 1](http://adventofcode.com/2017/day/1), part 1:

> The captcha requires you to review a sequence of digits (your puzzle input)
> and find the sum of all digits that match the next digit in the list. The
> list is circular, so the digit after the last digit is the first digit in the
> list.


Then for part 2:

> Now, instead of considering the next digit, it wants you to consider the
> digit halfway around the circular list.
